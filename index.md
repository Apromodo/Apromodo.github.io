### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 was one of my favorite assignments because I really enjoy playing blackjack. 
    It was enjoyable to work on something related to my interests, and through this assignment, 
    I was able to experiment with different algorithms and find a shorter solution using boolean logic. 
    I learned a lot from this experience.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, Part 2 I feel fortunate to have enjoyed this lab, as we covered the required topic in class the same morning. 
    While many of my classmates struggled due to not taking notes or attending the lecture, 
    I quickly grasped the concept and believe I finished the lab the fastest. 
    From this lab, I learned about creating nested loops and using predefined characters to draw shapes, 
    which helped me better understand the logic of loops. 


* Lab 9

    Lab 9, Part 1 It was fascinating to read data from files, merge them, and obtain an output. 
    It was a study that further advanced my logic of working with different files. 
    Additionally, this lab helped me improve my understanding of file operations and data manipulation. 
    It was intriguing to see how different files can be combined to create a meaningful output, 
    and it enhanced my skills in handling file-related tasks in programming
